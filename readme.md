# My configs
A place to backup my desktop Arch environment running `bspwm` and `polybar`, 
[here's an example of how it looks][sample-shot] (spoiler: it's VERY red). 
Other colourschemes can be found at `~/.config/xres/themes`.

# Some of the programs used here:
GUI stuff
*   bspwm;
*   sxhkd;
*   polybar.

Terminal related
*   urxvt;
*   xterm/uxterm;
*   bash;
*   zsh;

Text editors and document viewer
*   neovim -- uses [vim-plug][plug];
*   zathura.

File managers
*   nnn.

ps.: Some of the .files (sxhkd, polybar, Xresources, tmux and zathura) 
configure the fonts used ([ubuntu mono nerd font mono][nerdfonts] here).

pps.: You can use GNU's `stow` to link dotfiles.
